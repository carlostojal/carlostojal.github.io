                <div class="introduction">
                    Nowadays, all or almost all companies need a management system.<br>
                    As for business management, paper is not a modern thing. It takes more work to organize and is only physically accessible. And besides it is polluting the planet.<br>
                    Why all this embarassment, if you can have a management system, which is more secure and private than paper files, and allows you to run your business anywhere in the world?<br>
                    It is with this in mind that I develop management systems, as I think that I can help more companies to have their management more organized, secure, private, and easily accessible.
