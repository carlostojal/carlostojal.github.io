		<h1>Carlos Tojal</h1>

		<h2>About me:</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Carlos Tojal is a computer science student at the Polytechnic of Leiria. His passion for programming started at the age of 13. 
				His research focus is on autonomous mobile robotics and he has been actively involved in the "SafeForest" project for the past year. 
				The goal of this project is to design a robot to semi-autonomously clean forests, thus preventing the risk of wild fires.</p>

			<p>In addition to his research, Carlos has also been a member of the Formula Student team for the past year and is currently serving as the leader of the "Autonomous Driving" department. In this role, he is responsible for leading research and development, as well as supervising the work developed by the department. Formula Student is a competition for university students to design and build a single-seater from the ground up to compete against other universities.</p>
				
			<p>Carlos' interests include computer vision, autonomous systems, deep learning, and parallel computing. He is eager to expand his knowledge and make contributions in these fields through ongoing research and academic studies.</p>
				
			<p>In his free times, he plays in an orchestra.</p>
